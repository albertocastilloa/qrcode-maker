# qrcode-maker in Python
vCard-maker QR Code. Use it to give your business information to your clients

# The idea
Stop using tipical paper-made business card, instead, share your vCard using QR Code. Just read it using your phone and automatically it'll be added to your contact list

# How to use it
Just pass your personal info through 5 variables
n = First Name
ln = Last Name
e = E-mail
u = url
p = phone

get_full_qrcode(n, ln, e, u, p)
It will return a .svg QR code file ready to user or print.
